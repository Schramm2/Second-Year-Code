A2 Notes



Most of the synchronisation will be done on the shared object. Maybe the grid.



Anytime you need access a grid lock you need to lock that block from any other concurrent actions.



will need a flag variable to tell the variables when to pause but if you have a situation where something is not true and you have to wait for it to be true, a flag variable will not work. can’t solve start with a flag variable, use a latch to allow the threads to begin



don’t need a barrier



pause is a wait and a flag variable 



With the way the program is given to us it is broken, if the people go above near the red then it’s broken.





Q&A Session

People leaving the club must notify and decrement the total people in the club by 1.

Have to make people counter thread safe, atomic classes. Might want to notify on the entrance.

Look at bob alice while checking code, should be recorded.

Will need a wait in this code. One of the waits you can solve with a latch.

Threads are user level therefore the main thread will only finish when all the other threads are done.

Threads will take a while to start and pause which is fine.

Atomicboolean that is the pause, you will then cause wait on the boolean. If the boolean is true then the threads must wait(), and if it is false, you must notifyall() of the threads. 

Comment shows where to not modify.



Report must just be to tell what I did and why
